# Recursive_Partitioning
The Jupyter notebook above is written in R and serves to provide a walkthrough for the use of the recursive partitioning algorithm in a typical tabular data machine learning workflow. Overall, this is designed to be reader friendly and accessible rather than overly-technical. For more techical information on the recursive partitioning algorith, please visit the following resources:
